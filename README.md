Hey Opus, looking forward to working with you. I am coming at you with a pretty ambitious project to work on together.

I want to build an app/website that I call Neo Together.

Over the past decades, we have slowly lost offline communities. My belief is that this was a choice by people. Indeed, people would rather feel physically lonely than to bend to the hidden (or visible) rules of tranditional physical communities. People have however flocked to social media, where they get to find like-minded individuals, only engaging in things they care about. I want to take that a step further and bring those communities to the real world.

There is no text/voice/video communication on this app.

You land on the login/sign-up page. If you have a private key (see later), you enter that with your first name to login. Underneath is a sign-up page: you set your first name (from an existing list of names to prevent hate speech and other things), your birth year, your gender, your age. You then select from a list of topics you are interested in, which show up on your profile. You get a private key that allows you to login from anywhere.

Once in the app/website, you get to make a list of places you would be available to go to, and/or a radius around a given location. for each location you get to set a time range of when you're available to go at, and a repeat option (M T W T F S S). Add a little note saying not to worry, we will remind you 15 minutes before.

you can set yourself to Available or Unavailable. when you set yourself to available, . at no point does the user share location with the app. You also get to pick a time range you're available to go at.

In the app/website, you then get to see if anybody else has selected the same as you. If so, 

Once the match is finalized, it's time to meet in person. This will go one of two ways, the person shows up or does not. The next 
You get to thumbs up people you rate people: thumbs up or thumbs down, which shows on their profile.
In order to avoid people making fake profiles thumbs upping themselves.

I have never built apps before, my expertise is in machine learning research, so I will need some hand holding. I want you to explain to me everything you are doing.

I would like you to think about everything that I have laid down and make a plan on how to best go about building an MVP for this. 

Thank you very much for your hard work. Maximilien
