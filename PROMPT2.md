Hey Opus, looking forward to working with you.

I have a couple of issues I want to fix.

1. as of right now, when user X adds a spot, I dont see a way for user Y to be able to add this spot too. all he can do is press the spot, see there is 1 person there.

2. I would like to add a feature where users get to pick the age range of the people they are interested in meeting.

3. I would like a search bar where people can enter their location, right now its zoomed by default on new york.

4. I want the available/away feature to allow users to hide all of their availability until they press available again. this needs to be a note that the user sees to understand how it works.

5. When seeing people in a spot, I want it to display the overlapping interests, but also the person's interest that do not overlap.

6. I want that you can see the people's gender too.

7. I want that you can select a preference for certain genders and age range. the people shown in the people list for a spot will first show the people that match all criteria, then who match less etc, until no match.

8. I want to add a collection of tips to users, e.g. tell them if you see that people are selecting a bubble tea store, it's very likely to drink bubble tea, if it's a soccer field, it's very likely to play soccer.

9. It's a little bit repetitive for me to create separate profiles to test out how the interaction works. please make a couple of profiles of people, with all of their interests, preference decided and a few spots that they have selected.

10. Right now the app only allows you to meet one person at a time. I would like that when two users are interested in each other, those two users now form a group. In the people at spot X, those two users are now bundled, and you can now only show interest for the whole group. When that happens, we tell that new user that for now, you can assume that you can join the group, however the group will let you know if they would prefer to stay amongst themselves. What this means is we need to tell people this is a possibility, and they need to make sure to check the app (make this info as a tip).

11. I want people, in their preferences, to be able to select their preferences in terms of how big or small of a group they feel comfortable with. For instance, if a person sets the max to 3, no new people can be added to the group (a message is then shown to the user attempting to add itself to the group that one of the group members does not like groups getting bigger than what it currently is). On the other side, if a person sets the minimum to 3, the group is tentative. the other group members get informed that a person prefers groups to get at least to X people, and is thus not confirmed to join. this person however, can then accept to join regardless, and the users get notified.

12. the setup currently has a name and private key login system. I want to switch it to a mail system. people are automatically kept logged in, but if they want to connect to a new device they need to get the email again.

13. this whole app is open source, make sure this is visible to the users. add a little note to explain what it means and what it entails.

14. I want the app to have zero-access encryption just like Proton, make sure that this is also shown and explain what it is and give the example of proton.
